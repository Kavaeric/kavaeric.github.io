    <h2>1. The Agreement</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div class="number">1.1</div>
            This Agreement applies exclusively to <strong>non-commercial</strong> commissions
            only. It is subject to changes without notice.</li>

        <li><div class="number">1.2</div>
            The Client is commissioning the Artist for the creation of an original piece of
            artwork. Contingent upon payment and completion of that artwork, the Artist will
            issue a license outlined in this Agreement to allow the Client to use that artwork
            for non-commercial purposes. <strong>The Artist is neither selling nor delivering
            products, neither physical nor digital.</strong></li>

        <li><div class="number">1.3</div>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. Neither
            party is authorized to act as agent or bind the other party except as expressly
            stated in this Agreement.</li>

        <li><div class="number">1.4</div>
            The Client agrees that the Artist will not be liable for any damages (including, but not
            limited to, incidental or consequential damages) that arise from the Artist's
            performance of the commission. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to
            perform in a timely manner, regardless of whether the failure was intentional or
            negligent.</li>

        <li><div class="number">1.5</div>
            This Agreement does not create an exclusive relationship between the Client and
            the Artist. The Client is free to engage others to perform services of the same
            or similar nature to those provided by Artist. The Artist will be entitled to
            offer and provide services to others, solicit other clients and otherwise advertise
            the services offered by the Artist.</li>

        <li><div class="number">1.6</div>
            By sending payment, the Client agrees to all terms outlined in this Agreement.
            The Client agrees that a chargeback or reversal of payment will constitute a
            breach of these terms, resulting in the revocation of this grant of rights.</li>

        <li><div class="number">1.7</div>
            This Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws
            of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR).</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
    <h2 class="first">In simple terms</h2>
    <p>You're commissioning me for something that you won't use commercially. Make sure you understand
        my terms before you commission me.</p>
    <p>You're paying me for a <i>service</i>: My time, my effort, and my expertise. You're not paying
        for the painting or drawing itself, per se.</p>
    <p>We're not here to make decisions for each other, or be responsible for the other's actions.</p>
    <p>You can commission other people while I'm working on your commission. I can also take commissions
        from other people and also promote my art while I'm working on your commission.</p>
</div>

<div class="terms">
    <h2>2. Contact</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div class="number">2.1</div>

        <li><div class="number">2.2</div>
            The Artist accepts contact through <a href="&#104;&#116;&#116;&#112;&#115;://&#116;&#101;&#108;&#101;&#103;&#114;&#097;&#109;&#046;&#109;&#101;/&#107;&#097;&#118;&#097;&#101;&#114;&#105;&#099;">Telegram</a>,
            will only discuss commission work through a Telegram Group Chat created by the Artist.
            </li>
        <li><div class="number">2.3</div>
            The Client may contact the Artist in any number of ways before being redirected
            to any of the above methods at the Artist's discretion. The Artist does not guarantee
            a timely response if using any other contact method.</li>

        <li><div class="number">2.4</div>
            The Client must provide clear information, descriptions, and/or visual
            reference of the desired commissioned artwork. Afterwards, a price estimate
            will be given by the artist.</li>

        <li><div class="number">2.5</div>
            The Artist reserves the right to reject a commission for any reason, including
            no reason.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
        <h2>In simple terms</h2>
    <p>Contact me however, but I'll redirect you to correspond via Telegram, Discord, or email.
       You can find links to my contacts on each on the front page. If you want to talk on Telegram,
       I'll have to create a group chat first and add you to it, and that's where we'll conduct
       business.</p>

    <p>I'll give you a price estimate (not final) when you supply enough information about what you
        want for me to do so.</p>

    <p>I can say no for whatever reason. You won't be charged anything.</p>
</div>

<div class="terms">
    <h2>3. Work</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div class="number">3.1</div>
            Payment may only be made through the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li>PayPal via an invoice sent by the Artist, and in US dollars.</li>
            </ul>
            Payment will not be accepted in any other form unless otherwise exempted by the Artist.
            </li>

        <li><div class="number">3.2</div>
            Displayed prices are a guideline, and are be subject to change based on the complexity,
            difficulty, size, and medium of the individual work.</li>

        <li><div class="number">3.3</div>
            Payment must be made in full before work begins. After payment has been processed, the
            commission will be added to the artist’s work queue. Exceptions can be made for more
            expensive commissions, and payment plans can be negotiated with the Artist.</li>

        <li><div class="number">3.4</div>
            The Artist will work in a timely fashion to the best of their ability, however the Client
            understands that the Artist may delay work on a commission for any reason. Time-sensitive
            ("rush") commissions may be accepted with negotiation from the Artist, with a possible
            significant surcharge.</li>

        <li><div class="number">3.5</div>
            The Client will be allowed to request changes at any point of the commission.</li>
            
        <li><div class="number">3.6</div>
            Minor changes will be free of charge. Examples include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Shifts in hue/saturation/brightness;</li>
                <li>Simple flat colour changes;</li>
                <li>Adjustment and scaling of proportions in the sketch phase;</li>
                <li>Re-doing simple/small shapes and elements on the artwork.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><div class="number">3.7</div>
            Major changes are changes that deviate from the Client’s original commission information,
            descriptions, and/or visual references, and/or considerably increase the time needed for
            the commission. The changes may incur a fee that will be billed separately. The surcharge
            will be a minimum of 5 USD, and will vary from case-to-case. Examples include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Adjustment of the pose;</li>
                <li>Adjustment of major body parts, such as redrawing the limbs or head;</li>
                <li>Extensive changes to clothing;</li>
                <li>Extensive changes to colours, after flat colours have been added;</li>
                <li>Minor changes to details, such as those listed in 3.5, but requested after they
                    were approved or overlooked by the Client at a prior stage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><div class="number">3.8</div>
            Surcharges for major changes must be paid in full before the Client may receive the final,
            high-resolution, unwatermarked artwork.
        </li>

        <li><div class="number">3.9</div>
            The Artist reserves the right to reject any changes requested by the Client if the
            requested change is due to stylistic preference (such as linework, colouring style, or
            stylised proportions), or if the Artist believes it will harm the quality of the final
            piece.
        </li>

        <li><div class="number">3.10</div>
            The Artist reserves the right to work on their commission queue in any order, including
            non-chronologically.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
        <h2>In simple terms</h2>
    <p>I will only take payment via PayPal. I'm not interested in
        mailed cheques, physical cash, Steam gift cards, or anything of the sort. If you're paying with PayPal,
        I'll be sending an invoice.</p>
    <p>I'll do my best to work as efficiently as possible (average turnaround is right now less than one month),
        however I cannot make any guarantees. We can negotiate rush jobs, but there will be signifant surcharges
        added.</p>
    <p>You'll have to pay the whole quoted (invoiced) price before I start working. The quoted price
        may change from the listed price or inital estimates, usually from how difficult/complex
        the subject matter is.</p>
    <p>You can ask for changes whenever, but more major ones (usually requiring me to backtrack
        or undo a lot of work) will incur a surcharge. I'll invoice you seperately for these.</p>
</div>

<div class="terms">
    <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div class="number">4.1</div>
            The Client may cancel the commission before work begins for a full refund.</li>

        <li><div class="number">4.2</div>
            If the Client requests a refund after work has begun, the refundable amount will be
            proportional to the amount of incomplete work, adjusted at the Artist’s discretion.</li>

        <li><div class="number">4.3</div>
            The Client will not be given refunds after work has been completed.</li>

        <li><div class="number">4.4</div>
            The Artist may cancel a commission at any time before work is completed, and will issue
            a full refund to the Client. Reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Poor or immature behaviour from the Client;</li>
                <li>The inability to communicate with the Client clearly and effectively in English;</li>
                <li>The Artist dealing with an unforeseen inability to complete the commission.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
    <h2>In simple terms</h2>
    <p>You can cancel your commission at any time, but if I've started work then you'll probably
        still have to pay for what work I've done. You won't get a refund after I'm done the work.</p>
    <p>Bad stuff happens sometimes, and I might cancel the commission, in which case you will get
        fully refunded.</p>
</div>

<div class="terms">
    <h2>5. Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><div class="number">5.1</div>

                <li>Using the artwork to promote their own non-commercial material.</li>
            </ul></li>

        <li><div class="number">5.5</div>
            The Client may publicly distribute, display, or repost low-resolution versions of the
            artwork, accompanied with a credit line to the Artist, as expressed in 5.4. The client may not use
            the high-resolution artwork for these purposes.</li>

        <li><div class="number">5.6</div>
            The Client may produce prints of the high-resolution artwork for private use.</li>

        <li><div class="number">5.7</div>
            The Client may not use the commissioned artwork for commercial projects. Examples include:

                <li>Selling physical prints or pieces of merchandise of the artwork;</li>

                <li>Selling one’s own material, with the artwork attached to the material, such as
                    on the cover of a music album.</li>
            </ul>
            The Client may purchase additional licensing for use in commercial projects.
            Terms will be discussed in private.</li>

        <li><div class="number">5.8</div>
            The Client may include the original artwork upon transfer or sale of the featured
            character(s) or intellectual property. The Artist will retain all rights granted under

        <li><div class="number">5.9</div>

            The Client may not have another artist draw over, rework, or alter the commissioned
            artwork, including the removal of the artist’s signatures or watermarks.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="explanation">
    <h2>In simple terms</h2>
    <p>I can showcase the final artwork, such as uploading it onto sites like Weasyl or ArtStation.
        I might make merchandise out of them, but because of 5.3 I can only do so if they're made generic.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which, while the artwork itself (the drawing, painting, whatever) is mine, any
        intellectual property like characters or logos of yours will remain yours.</p>
    <p>You can showcase the artwork, use it for avatars, and so forth, but you can't use it to make
        your own merchandise or as official artwork for products you're selling, like books or music.
        If you wish to do so, we can negotiate a commercial licensing grant, which'll allow you to
        do those things.</p>
    <p>If you transfer ownership of your intellectual property, you can also transfer the license for
        the artwork over as well. For example, if you sell a character, any artwork you commissioned
        from me of that character can be included in the sale as well. Under the new owner, though,
        I'll still keep the rights to the artwork.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you can't claim this as the work of anyone but me.</p>
</div>
